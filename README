quirky moments in your life that can only happen in the movies -- but they
happened to you.

The application runs on any iPhone or iPad device.

  TODO: The AppIcon is a bit hard to see. Need to re do with darker color scheme

-- color palette --
white 247 247 237
pink 227 201 188
violet 202 209 217
gray 212 213 205
camel 199 169 131
bronze 89 86 79

-- Font --
Right now using Helvetica Neue. The logo uses something very close to Skia. I have
added this ttf to the project, but it looked less than acceptable in the simulator.

TODO: Check Skia on actual devices to assess quality.
